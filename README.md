# ABC Call Volume Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing customer experiences for a company's inbound calling team through comprehensive data analysis and solution evaluation using Microsoft Excel. The project involves the utilization of Excel formulas for data gathering, preprocessing, and analysis, along with the integration of AI tools like Interactive Voice Response and Predictive Analytics for data-driven insights. The primary goal is to assess and optimize agent performance in handling incoming calls, with a direct impact on customer satisfaction.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Gathering**: Collect and organize data related to incoming customer calls and agent performance.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for accurate analysis.
3. **Analysis Phase**: Employ Excel functions and formulas to analyze agent performance metrics.
4. **AI Integration**: Collaborate with AI tools like Interactive Voice Response and Predictive Analytics for data-driven insights.
5. **Performance Evaluation**: Assess the impact of agent performance on customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Tools and Resources
- Microsoft Excel for data analysis and solution assessment.
- AI tools: Interactive Voice Response, Predictive Analytics, Intelligent Routing.

## Project Findings
### Average Duration of Calls
- Consistent call durations (190-205 seconds) enhance service experience, optimize staffing, set performance benchmarks, visually validated by a clustered column chart.

### Call Volume Patterns
- Time-based call volume patterns reveal a consistent peak between 11 AM and 12 PM, indicating the need for extra resources during this period.

### Minimum Agents Required
- Precise staffing during peaks reduces abandon rates; assumption-driven strategies aim for a 10% abandon rate with a 90% call answer rate.

### Manpower Planning
- Insights reveal peak staffing needs during specific time buckets, emphasizing the importance of morning boosts and nighttime optimization.

## Project Insights and Conclusions
- Call Volume Patterns: Peak hours at 11 AM to 12 PM highlight the need for optimized staffing.
- Consistent Call Durations: Call durations within 190 to 205 seconds offer predictability, enabling efficient resource allocation.
- Agent Shortages: Addressing shortages during critical time periods is essential.
- Manpower Planning Strategies: Assumption-driven plans aim to reduce the abandon rate to 10%, emphasizing the importance of night shift optimization.

These insights guide strategies to enhance customer experiences, optimize agent staffing, and address operational challenges within the call center.
